## Potential Issues in the CurseForge AutoUpdate Go Codebase (as of July 2025)

### 1. Error Handling
- Some error returns are generic and may not provide enough context for debugging (e.g., in version parsing, backup validation).
- Not all errors are logged or surfaced to the user, especially in CLI commands and helper functions.

### 2. Configuration Validation
- Configuration validation is present but could be stricter (e.g., checking for valid paths, file permissions, and value ranges).
- Some config fields (like webhook URLs, Discord settings) are only checked if enabled, but missing/invalid values may still cause runtime errors.

### 3. Code Duplication & Structure
- Some logic (e.g., version comparison, file existence checks) is repeated in helpers and could be further modularized.

### 4. Testing & Coverage
- No evidence of comprehensive unit or integration tests for critical workflows (API, backup, update, notification).
- No automated test coverage reporting or CI badge in the repo.

### 5. Logging & Observability
- Logging is inconsistent; some errors are printed, others are returned or ignored.
- No structured logging or log levels in the Go CLI.
- No audit trail for destructive operations (e.g., backup deletion).

### 6. Security Practices
- API keys are handled via config, but no mention of secure storage or redaction in logs.
- File system operations may be vulnerable to path traversal if not carefully validated.
- No explicit input sanitization for user-supplied values (e.g., CLI args, config fields).

### 7. Worst Practices / Code Smells
- Use of magic numbers for status codes and config values (should use named constants everywhere).
- Some functions (e.g., in backup, version helpers) are large and could be split for clarity.
- Some error messages are not user-friendly or actionable.

### 8. Documentation & Comments
- Some exported functions lack doc comments (Go best practice).
- No clear CONTRIBUTING.md or developer setup guide.

### 9. Gaps in Go Implementation (compared to planned features)
- No version tracking or filtering by mod loader/version.
- No manifest extraction or multi-mod support.
- Some error handling and recovery options are still basic.

### 10. Planned Features Not Yet Implemented
- Scheduling, rollback, multi-server support, and advanced notification are planned but not present.
- No web dashboard or advanced monitoring.

## Steps to Fix and Improve

1. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Add contextual error messages and wrap errors where possible.
   - Ensure all errors are logged or surfaced to the user.

2. **Strengthen Configuration Validation**
   - Validate all config fields, including file paths and URLs, at startup.
   - Add checks for file/directory permissions and existence.

3. **Reduce Code Duplication**
   - Refactor helpers to centralize common logic (e.g., file checks, version parsing).

4. **Add Comprehensive Testing**
   - Write unit and integration tests for all critical workflows.
   - Add CI/CD with test coverage reporting.

5. **Enhance Logging and Observability**
   - Use structured logging with log levels (info, warn, error, debug).
   - Add audit logs for destructive actions (backup deletion, restore).

6. **Harden Security**
   - Redact API keys and sensitive info in logs.
   - Validate and sanitize all user/config input.
   - Review file system operations for path traversal and permission issues.

7. **Refactor for Maintainability**
   - Split large functions into smaller, focused units.
   - Replace magic numbers with named constants.
   - Add/expand doc comments for all exported functions.

8. **Improve Documentation**
   - Add a CONTRIBUTING.md and developer setup guide.
   - Document all config options and command usage.

9. **Address Gaps in Go Implementation**
   - Add version tracking, filtering, and manifest extraction as planned.

10. **Implement Planned Features**
    - Follow the roadmap in PLAN.md for scheduling, rollback, multi-server, and notification improvements.
    - Add monitoring and web dashboard as planned.

**Note:** This list is not exhaustive. Regular code reviews, static analysis (e.g., golangci-lint, gosec), and user feedback should be used to continuously improve code quality and reliability.
