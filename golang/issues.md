## Potential Issues in the CurseForge Auto-Update Codebase (Golang)

### 1. Error Handling
- Some functions (especially in helpers and notification modules) return generic errors or simply return `false` on failure (e.g., `FileExists`, `DirExists`). This can make debugging difficult and may hide the root cause of issues.
- Not all errors are wrapped with context, which can make tracing problems harder.

### 2. Configuration Validation
- The config validation is present, but some fields (like notification URLs, backup paths) may not be validated for format or existence, only for non-emptiness.
- No schema validation for TOML/YAML/JSON config files, so malformed configs may not be caught early.

### 3. Testing Coverage
- There is only minimal unit testing (see `compare_test.go` for version comparison). Most business logic, API, and CLI commands lack tests.
- No integration or end-to-end tests for update, backup, or notification flows.

### 4. Logging and Observability
- Logging is not consistently used across all modules. Some helpers and internal logic do not log errors or important events.
- No structured logging or log levels, which can make troubleshooting in production harder.

### 5. Security Practices
- API keys and sensitive config are handled via config files, but there is no mention of secure storage or environment variable fallback.
- No input sanitization for user-supplied paths or config values (potential path traversal or injection risk).
- No explicit HTTPS enforcement for webhooks or API calls.

### 6. Code Quality and Maintainability
- Some helpers (e.g., version parsing) use complex regex and manual parsing, which could be replaced with well-tested libraries.
- Some functions return zero values on error (e.g., `GetMajorVersion` returns 0), which can mask bugs if not checked properly.
- Some code is duplicated (e.g., similar validation logic for Discord and webhook notifications).
- No use of Go interfaces for notification or backup strategies, which would improve extensibility.

### 7. Worst Practices / Code Smells
- Silent failures: returning `false` or `nil` without logging or error context.
- Large functions with multiple responsibilities (e.g., backup validation, config loading).
- Lack of context propagation for errors (no use of `errors.Wrap` or similar).
- No rate limiting or retry logic for network/API calls.

### 8. Documentation and Comments
- Some exported functions lack doc comments.
- No clear documentation for environment variables or advanced config options.

### 9. Dependency Management
- No `go.mod` replace directives for local development or dependency pinning for critical libraries.
- No automated dependency update workflow.

### 10. Planned Features Not Yet Implemented
- Scheduling, rollback, multi-server support, and advanced notification features are planned but not present.
- No manifest-based modpack version tracking yet (see roadmap).

## Steps to Fix and Improve

1. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Always return errors with context (use `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)` or a wrapping library).
   - Avoid returning `false` or zero values on error; prefer explicit error returns.
   - Add logging for all error cases.

2. **Increase Test Coverage**
   - Add unit tests for all helpers, config, and notification logic.
   - Add integration tests for update, backup, and notification flows.
   - Use CI to run tests on every commit.

3. **Enhance Configuration Validation**
   - Add format/path validation for all config fields.
   - Consider using a schema validation library for TOML/YAML/JSON.
   - Validate existence of paths and URLs at startup.

4. **Strengthen Security**
   - Support environment variable overrides for sensitive config.
   - Sanitize all user/config input (paths, URLs).
   - Enforce HTTPS for all network operations.
   - Consider using a secrets manager for API keys in production.

5. **Refactor for Maintainability**
   - Use interfaces for notification and backup strategies.
   - Reduce code duplication (e.g., shared validation logic).
   - Split large functions into smaller, focused units.

6. **Improve Logging and Observability**
   - Add structured logging with log levels (info, warn, error).
   - Log all critical operations and failures.

7. **Update Documentation**
   - Add doc comments for all exported functions and types.
   - Document all config/environment variables and advanced options.

8. **Automate Dependency Management**
   - Use tools like Dependabot or Renovate for dependency updates.
   - Pin critical dependencies and audit for vulnerabilities.

9. **Implement Planned Features**
   - Follow the roadmap in `PLAN.md` to add missing features (scheduling, rollback, manifest tracking, etc).

10. **Adopt Best Practices**
   - Use Go modules and tidy up dependencies regularly.
   - Run `gosec` and `golangci-lint` as part of CI.
   - Review and refactor code for clarity and maintainability.
